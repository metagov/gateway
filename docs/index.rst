Metagov Documentation
=====================

Metagov is a unified API gateway for digital governance services. It's designed to support rapid prototyping of governance systems, decision-making processes, and social workflows across a range of platforms, from forums to chat services to blockchains. To help people prototype, Metagov ships with a powerful driver for authoring governance policies over multiple platforms.

Metagov is a prototype under active development, so please help us out by sending us feedback at hello@metagov.org or by opening an issue on our GitHub.
