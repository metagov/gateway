About Metagov
=============

Metagov is a unified API gateway for digital governance services.
It's designed to support rapid prototyping of governance systems, decision-making processes, and
social workflows across a range of platforms, from forums to chat services to blockchains.

Metagov is meant to be deployed alongside a "governance driver," which is loosely defined as any application
that authors governance policies. `PolicyKit <https://www.policykit.org/>`_ is a powerful governance driver
that integrates with Metagov, enabling policy authors to make use of the governance services
that are exposed in the `Metagov API <https://prototype.metagov.org/redoc/>`_.

**Currently supported governance services and platforms:**

* `Open Collective <https://www.opencollective.com>`_
* `Loomio <https://www.loomio.org>`_
* `SourceCred <https://www.sourcecred.io>`_
* `NEAR <https://www.near.org>`_
* `Discourse <https://www.discourse.org/>`_
* `Web Monetization <https://webmonetization.org/>`_
* Slack
..
    * `Stanford Participatory Budgeting Platform <https://pbstanford.org/>`_
