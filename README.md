# Metagov Gateway

_Update June 2024: Development of Metagov Gateway has mostly been folded into [PolicyKit](https://github.com/policykit/policykit). Visit the PolicyKit repo (or join the Metagov Slack) to contribute!_

The Metagov Gateway is an open-source API gateway for online communities. It helps communities govern themselves by connecting decision-making tools to platforms where decisions need to be made. Itâ€™s designed to support rapid prototyping of governance systems, decision-making processes, and social workflows across a range of platforms, from forums to chat services to blockchains. To help people prototype, Metagov ships with a powerful driver, PolicyKit, for authoring governance policies.
