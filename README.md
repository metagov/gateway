# Metagov Gateway

The Metagov Gateway is an open-source API gateway for online communities. It helps communities govern themselves by connecting decision-making tools to platforms where decisions need to be made. It’s designed to support rapid prototyping of governance systems, decision-making processes, and social workflows across a range of platforms, from forums to chat services to blockchains. To help people prototype, Metagov ships with a powerful driver, PolicyKit, for authoring governance policies.

The Gateway currently supports:
- Discord
- Slack
- Discourse
- GitHub
- Open Collective
- Loomio
- SourceCred
- NEAR
- Web Monetization

The Gateway is part of the [Metagovernance Project](www.metagov.org). We're a nonprofit research group building standards and infrastructure for digital self-governance.
